/**
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for the CV Spark AI application.
 * All user-generated content, including profiles and CVs, is secured to ensure
 * that only the authenticated owner of the data can access or modify it.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model is built on the principle of least privilege. By default, all
 * access is denied. Rules explicitly grant permissions only to the authenticated
 * owner of a specific data resource.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized hierarchically to simplify security. Each user's data is
 * stored under a unique path:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores the user's public profile.
 * - /users/{userId}/cvs/{cvId}: A subcollection containing all CVs created by that user.
 * This path-based ownership makes rules simple, performant, and easy to audit.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Listing Disabled: It is not possible to list all users in the `/users` collection.
 *   This is a critical privacy feature to prevent scraping of user data.
 * - Strict Ownership: All operations (read, write, delete) on a user's data tree
 *   (their profile and their CVs) are restricted to the user whose UID matches the
 *   `{userId}` in the path.
 * - Relational Integrity: On document creation, the rules validate that the owner ID
 *   field within the document's data (e.g., `User.uid`, `Cv.userId`) matches the
 *   `{userId}` from the path. This field is enforced as immutable on updates to
 *   prevent documents from being "re-assigned" to another user.
